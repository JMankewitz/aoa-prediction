Introduction Despite tremendous individual variation in rate of development the first words that children utter are strikingly consistent they tend to talk about important people in their life mom dad social routines hi uh oh animals dog duck and foods milk banana Even as children learn from their own experiences and according to their own interests their vocabulary grows rapidly typically adding more nouns but also verbs go and other predicates hot to their repertoires Over just their first three years children learn hundreds or even thousands of words One classic approach to word learning focuses on the specific mechanisms that children bring to bear on the learning problem For example across many laboratory experiments a variety of mechanisms have been identified as plausible drivers of early word learning including cooccurrence based and crosssituational word learning social cue use and syntactic bootstrapping The ability to identify which of these mechanisms is most explanatory has been challenging Indeed many theories of early word learning take multiplicity of cue types and mechanisms as a central feature eg As important as this work is though these studies typically are aimed at understanding how one or a small handful of words are learned in the laboratory under preciselydefined learning conditions They do not directly address questions regarding the developmental composition and ordering of growth in the lexicon across many different children in their natural environments nor whether these patterns are consistent across different languages Why are some words learned so early and some much later This question about the order of the acquisition of first words can provide a different window into the nature of childrens language learning Posed as a statistical problem the challenge is to find what set of variables best predicts the age at which different words are acquired Previous work using this approach has revealed that in English within a lexical category eg nouns verbs words that are more frequent in speech to children are likely to be learned earlier Further studies have found evidence that a variety of other semantic and linguistic factors are related to word acquisition such as salience and iconicity But these exciting findings are limited in their generality because each study used a different dataset and focused on different predictors In addition nearly all studies to date have exclusively analyzed data from Englishlearning children providing no opportunity for crosslinguistic comparison of the relative importance of the many relevant factors under consideration Crosslinguistic comparisons are critical to identifying the universal mechanisms that are in play for all children and differentiating them from patterns of acquisition that emerge due to the particulars of a given language or culture Thus our goal here is to extend these classic approaches by assessing the degree to which the predictors of word learning are consistent across different languages and cultures as well as whether there are similar patterns across different word types eg nouns vs verbs The primary tool for characterizing the breadth of childrens early vocabularies in these previous studies has been structured parent report Naturalistic language samples and experimental methods are both valuable methods for assessing aspects of child language But outside of a few ultradense transcripts eg neither method typically provides the kind of holistic and comprehensive view that comes from parent report We focus in particular on the MacArthurBates Communicative Development Inventory CDI a family of parentreport vocabulary checklists in which parents are asked whether their child either understands or understands and says a large set of individual words The CDIs are an inexpensive and widelyused method for gathering reliable and valid data about the nature and extent of young childrens productive and receptive vocabularies see for review cf Although CDIs cannot exhaustively capture all words in a childs vocabulary they do give an estimate of a childs knowledge about several hundred words far more than the handful that are typically tested in a lab experiment CDI estimates of vocabulary size are highly correlated with childrens overall vocabulary knowledge as assessed with naturalistic observation or using standardized tests Of course any parent report measure is subject to reporting biases The CDIs were designed to minimize these by asking parents to report only on observable behaviors that are currently rather than retrospectively demonstrated and to identify words from a preselected list rather than having them recall them on their own Because of the low cost of administering CDI instruments compared with transcribing naturalistic recordings it is far easier to gather samples containing data about hundreds or thousands of children Such large samples in turn make it possible to recover stable estimates of the average difficulty of individual words even if individual childrens data may be noisy Thus CDI data are typically the dataset of choice for the studies of vocabulary composition described above Finally CDI instruments have been used in dozens of different languages providing an opportunity for crosslinguistic comparison The American English CDI is not simply translated to other languages verbatim however instead expert groups of researchers adapt the form for their particular linguistic and cultural situation as well as their scientific goal This process leads to a wide range of forms with a common structure but that contain sets of words that are customized to a particular language and culture Thus crosslinguistic comparisons do not reflect childrens acquisition of a single set of words but instead capture relevant information regarding patterns of childrens vocabulary development across many different languages using instruments that are designed specifically for each language In our study we conduct crosslinguistic comparisons of the acquisition trajectories childrens earlylearned words using Wordbank wordbankstanfordeduhttpwordbankstanfordedu an open repository that aggregates administrations of the CDI across languages Wordbank currently includes data from over children in languages from which the analyses here use data from over children in languages This large sample means that idiosyncratic patterns of individual variation are less likely to overpower general trends in which words out of the particular sets of words in each language are relatively easier or harder to learn allowing us to investigate what features affect their acquisition across languagescourse observational data of this type are still open to other sources of bias a point we return to in the Discussion In our analyses we integrate estimates of words acquisition trajectories from the Wordbank data with independentlyderived characterizations of the word learning environment from other datasets The use of secondary datasets for these analyses is warranted because no currently available resource provides data on both childrens language environments and their learning outcomes for more than a small handful of children In particular we derive our estimates of the language environment from transcripts of speech to children in the CHILDES database and measures of meaningrelated word properties from available psycholinguistic databases This dataintegration methodology was originated by it relies on large samples to average out the substantial differences between children and care environments and has several advantages over an approach where both word acquisition information and word usage are derived from the same datasets While introducing additional sources of variability it also allows for analyses that cannot be performed on smaller datasets or datasets that measure only children or environments but not both As our particular measures of environmental input we used existing data from the CHILDES database to estimate each words a frequency in parent speech to children b mean length of the parent utterances containing that word MLU c frequency as a sole utterance constituent and d frequency in utterancefinal position While these measures are crude they are both easy to compute and relatively comparable across the languages in our sample To derive proxies for the meaningbased properties of each word we accessed available psycholinguistic norms using adult ratings of each words a concreteness b valence c arousal and d association with babies Integrating these two groups measures which are based respectively on estimates of childrens linguistic environment and words meanings we predict each words acquisition trajectory We assess the relative contributions of each predictor as well as how those predictors change over development and interact with the lexical category of the word being predicted Since vocabulary composition differs in comprehension and production eg we conduct our analyses on measures of each These analyses address two questions First we ask about the degree of consistency across languages in the relative importance of each predictor To do so we compare the estimates for the effect of each predictor for each language and conduct analyses that determine the likelihood that the consistency of the estimates is not likely to occur by chance Consistency in the patterning of predictors would suggest that similar information sources are important for learners regardless of language and that linguistic dissimilarities eg greater morphological complexity in Russian and Turkish greater phonological complexity in Danish do not dramatically alter the course of acquisition Conversely evidence for variability across languages would show the degree to which learners face different challenges in learning different languages posing a challenge for more universalist accounts Further systematicity in the variability between languages would reveal which languages are more similar than others in the structure of these different challenges Second we ask which lexical categories are most influenced by linguistic environment factors like frequency and utterance length compared with meaningbased factors like concreteness and valence Division of dominance theory suggests that nouns might be more sensitive to meaning factors while predicates and closedclass words might be more sensitive to linguistic environment factors And on syntactic bootstrapping theories nouns are argued to be learned via frequent cooccurrence operationalized by frequency while verbs might be more sensitive to syntactic factors operationalized here by utterance length Thus examining the relative contribution of different predictors across lexical categories can help test the predictions of influential theories of acquisition Methods Acquisition trajectories To estimate the trajectory of words acquisition we used vocabulary data collected using CDI instruments adapted in many different languages including both Words Gestures WG forms for younger children and Words Sentences WS forms for older children When filling out a CDI form parents are either asked to indicate whether their child understands comprehension or understands and says production each of around words Both comprehension and production are queried for younger children and only production is queried for older children We use data from the items on the WG form for our comprehension measure and data from the items in common between the WG and WS forms for our production measure Table gives an overview of our acquisition data also see SI Figure for the age distributions in the data Each of the datasets were collected in contexts in which the particular language was the language of the community eg the Mexican Spanish CDI data were collected in several areas of Mexico longitudinal administrations were excluded For each word the CDI data yield a trajectory reflecting the number of children that are reported to understand or produce the word at each age covered by the instrument see Figure for some examples Word properties Overview Each of our predictors is derived from independent sources For each word that appears on the CDI forms in each of our languages we used corpora of childdirected speech in that language from CHILDES to obtain an estimate of its frequency the mean length of utterances in which it appears its frequency as the sole constituent of utterance and its frequency in utterance final position with frequency residualized out of solo and final frequencies Additionally we computed each words length in phonemes To capture meaningbased factors in acquisition we included ratings of each words concreteness valence arousal and relatedness to babies All of these ratings were compiled based on previous studies using adult raters In addition since existing datasets for all of these ratings are primarily available for English we mapped all the words in our datasets onto translation equivalents across CDI forms verified by native speaker judgement allowing us to use the ratings for English words across languages Of the resulting translation equivalent meanings occur only in one language occur in more than one but not all languages and occur in all languages While necessarily imperfect this method allows us to examine languages for which limited resources exist Example words for these predictors in English are shown in Table also see SI Figure for the distributions of values of each predictor A word about the babiness predictor Previous studies have shown robust consistency in the types of words that children learn very early These words seem to describe concepts that are important or exciting in the lives of infants in a way that standard psycholinguistic features like concreteness do not Capturing this intuition quantitatively is difficult but provides a proxy measure as a first step This measure is simply the degree to which a particular word was associated with babies Intuitively we expect this measure to capture the degree to which words like ball or bottle feature heavily in the environment and presumably mental life of many babies Each numeric predictor was centered and scaled so that all predictors would have comparable units For each predictor missing values CDI items that were not in the relevant corpus or norms were imputed from the mean for their respective language and measure Placeholder items such as childs own name were excluded Frequency For each language we estimated word frequency from unigram counts based on all corpora in CHILDES for that language Frequencies varied widely both within and across lexical categories see SI Figure Each words count includes the counts of words that share the same stem so that dogs counts as dog or are synonymous so that father counts as daddy For polysemous word pairs eg orange as in color or fruit occurrences of the word in the corpus were split uniformly between the senses on the CDI there were only between and such word pairs in the various languages in the absence of crosslinguistic corpus resources for polysemy sense disambiguation this is a necessary simplification Counts were normalized to the length of each corpus Laplace smoothed ie count of were replaced with counts of and then log transformed Solo and Final Frequencies Using the same dataset as for frequency we estimated the frequency with which each of word occurs as the sole word in an utterance and the frequency with which it appears as the final word of an utterance not counting singleword utterances As with frequency solo and final counts were normalized to the length of each corpus Laplace smoothed and log transformed Since both of these estimates are by necessity highly correlated with frequency we then residualized unigram frequency out of both of them so that values reflect an estimate of the effects of solo frequency and final frequency over and above frequency itself MLU MLU is only a rough proxy for syntactic complexity but is relatively straightforward to compute across languages in contrast to other metrics For each language we estimated each words MLU by calculating the mean length in words of the utterances in which that word appeared for all corpora in CHILDES for that language For words that occurred fewer than times MLU estimates were treated as missing Number of phonemes In the absence of consistent resources for crosslinguistic pronunciation we computed the number of phonemes in each word in each language based on phonemic transcriptions of each word obtained using the eSpeak tool We then spotchecked these transcriptions for accuracy Concreteness We used previously collected norms for concreteness which were gathered by asking adult participants to rate how concrete the meaning of each word is on a point scale from abstract to concrete Valence and Arousal We also used previously collected norms for valence and arousal for which adult participants were asked to rate words on a happyunhappy scale valence and excitedcalm scale arousal Babiness Lastly we used previously collected norms of babiness a measure of association with infancy for which adult participants were asked to judge a words association with babies on a scale Lexical category Category was determined on the basis of the conceptual categories presented on the CDI form eg Animals Action Words such that the Nouns category contains common nouns Predicates contains verbs and adjectives and Function Words contains closedclass words following A potential concern for comparing coefficient estimates is predictor collinearity Fortunately in every language the only relatively high correlations were between MLU and solo frequency mean over languages as expected given the similarity of these factors along with modest correlations between frequency and concreteness mean over languages and between frequency and number of phonemes mean over languages a reflection of Zipfs Law More importantly the variance inflation factor for each of the predictors in each language is no greater than indicating that multicollinearity among the predictors is low see SI Figure for the full set of pairwise correlations and SI Figure for the variance inflation factors Analysis We used mixedeffects logistic regression models fit with the MixedModels package in Julia to predict whether each child understandsproduces each word from the childs age properties of the word and interactions between age and each property of the word Each model was fit to all data from a particular language and included a random intercept for each word and a random slope of age for each word We also fit such models separately to the words in each lexical category The magnitude of the standardized coefficient on each feature gives an estimate of its effect on whether words are learned earlier or later Interactions between features and age give estimates of how this effect is modulated for earlier and laterlearned words For example a positive effect of association with babies babiness means that words associated with babies are learned earlier a negative interaction with age means that high babiness primarily leads to higher rates of production and comprehension for younger children Results Predictor effects Figure shows the coefficient estimates for English comprehension data while Figure shows the coefficient estimate for each predictor in each language for additional visualizations of the coefficients estimates see SI Figures and We find that frequency mean over languages and measures babiness concreteness and solo frequency are relatively stronger predictors of acquisition across languages as well as all having significant effects at in at least of the languages and measure These effects along with final frequency and valence are positive in all or almost languages so words with higher babiness tend to be known by more children while the effects of number of phonemes and MLU are negative in all or almost all languages so longer words tend to be known by fewer children Given the emphasis on frequency effects in the language acquisition literature one might have expected frequency to dominate but several other predictors are just as strong in this analysis In addition some factors previously argued to be important for word learning namely valence and arousal appear to have limited relevance when compared to other factors both have and are only significant in languages and measures These results provide a strong argument for our approach of including multiple predictors and languages in our analysis Consistency Overall there is considerable consistency in the magnitudes of predictors across languages In almost all babiness and frequency were highest while valence and arousal were smaller A priori it could have been the case that different languages have wildly different effects of various factors eg due to linguistic or cultural differences in acquisition process but this pattern is not what we observe Instead there is considerable consistency in the correlations between coefficients across languages As shown in Figure each languages mean pairwise correlation with other languages coefficients ie the correlation of coefficients for English with coefficients for Russian for Spanish and so on is between and These correlation means are far outside of bootstrapped estimates in a randomized baseline created by shuffling predictor coefficients within language meaning that coefficient estimates are far more consistent across languages than would be expected by chance Variability While some particular coefficients differ substantially from the trend across languages eg the effect of frequency for Spanish is near these individual datapoints are difficult to interpret Many unmeasurable factors could potentially account for these differences For example Spanish frequency estimates could be less accurate due to corpus sparsity or idiosyncrasy the samples of children in the Spanish CDI data and CHILDES data could differ more demographically or Spanishspeaking children could in fact rely less on frequency in acquisition Rather than attempting to interpret individual coefficients we instead ask how the patterns of difference among languages reflect systematic substructure in the variability of the effects To examine the substructure of predictor variability we used hierarchical clustering analysis to find the similarity structure among the pairwise correlations between languages predictors The resulting dendrograms are shown in Figure which broadly reflect language typology especially for production data This result suggests that some languagetolanguage similarity data is captured by the profile of coefficient magnitudes our analysis returns Comprehension vs production Word length is the one predictor of acquisition that varied substantially between measures it is far more predictive for production than comprehension Thus as measured here length seems to reflect effects of production constraints ie how difficult a word is to say rather than than comprehension constraints ie how difficult it is to store or access This result may explain why the hierarchical clustering analysis above appears more similar to linguistic typology in the production case than the comprehension case the role of production difficulty may be more similar for more typologically related languages Developmental change We also wanted to examine how the relative contributions of the predictors changes over development For both comprehension and production positive age interactions can be seen in at least out of languages for concreteness and frequency Conversely there are negative age interactions for babiness valence and arousal for comprehension in at least out of languages This suggests that while concreteness and frequency facilitate learning they tend to do so more later in the development and while babiness valence and arousal facilitate learning as well they then to do so more earlier in development This result is consistent with the speculation above that the babiness predictor captures meanings that have special salience to very young infants Lexical categories Previous work gives reason to believe that predictors relationship with age of acquisition differs among various lexical categories To investigate these effects we separated our data by lexical category and fit separate models for each category Figure shows the resulting coefficient estimates Across languages frequency had the highest magnitude for nouns and a lower magnitude for function words In contrast MLU was almost irrelevant for both nouns and predicates but highly predictive for function words These patterns are supportive of the hypothesis that different word classes are learned in different ways or at least that the bottleneck on learning tends to be different leading to different information sources being more or less important across categories Additionally the mean pairwise correlation of coefficients between languages is much larger for nouns and predicates than for function words The higher betweenlanguage variability for function words suggests the learning processes differ substantially more across languages for function words than they do for content words see SI Figure Discussion What makes words easier or harder for young children to learn Previous experimental work has largely addressed this question using smallscale lab studies While such experiments can identify sources of variation they typically do not allow for different sources to be compared directly In contrast observational studies allow the effects of individual factors to be measured across ages and lexical categories eg but are limited in the size and scope of the datasets and languages that can be directly compared The current analyses take advantage of recent innovative approaches via Wordbank a large crosslinguistic dataset of parent report instruments By compiling data regarding early lexical development across languages and examining patterns of acquisition in relation to predictors our work expands the scope of these studies dramatically leading to several new findings First we found consistency in the patterning of predictors across languages at a level substantially greater than the predictions of a chance model This consistency supports the idea that differences in culture or language structure do not lead to fundamentally different acquisition strategies at least at the level of detail we were able to examine Instead they are likely produced by processes that are similar across populations and languages Such processes could include learning mechanisms or biases internal to children or interactional dynamics between children or caregivers We believe these consistencies should be an important topic for future investigation Second predictors varied substantially in their weights across lexical categories Frequent concrete nouns were learned earlier consistent with theories that emphasize the importance of early referential speech eg But for predicates concreteness was somewhat less important And for function words MLU was more predictive perhaps because it is easiest to decode the meanings of function words that are used in short sentences or because such words have meanings that are easiest to decode Overall these findings are consistent with some predictions of both division of dominance theory which highlights the role of conceptual structure in noun acquisition and syntactic bootstrapping theory which emphasizes linguistic structure over conceptual complexity in the acquisition of lexical categories other than nouns More generally our methods here provide a way forward for testing the predictions of these theories across languages and at the level of the entire lexicon rather than individual words In addition to these new insights several findings emerged that confirm and expand previous reports Environmental frequency was an important predictor of learning with more frequentlyheard words learned earlier Predictors also changed in relative importance across development For example certain words whose meanings were more strongly associated with babies appeared to be learned early for children across the languages in our sample as in Finally word length showed a dissociation between comprehension and production suggesting that challenges in production do not carry over to comprehension at least in parentreport data Despite its larger scope our work shares a number of important limitations with previous studies First and foremost our approach is to predict one set of individuals with data about the experience of a completely different set and ratings of concepts gathered from yet others In contrast to densedata analyses this approach fundamentally limits the amount of variability we will be able to capture In addition the granularity of the predictors that can be extracted from corpus data and applied to every word is necessarily quite coarse Ideally predictors could be targeted more specifically at particular theoretical constructs of interest for example the patterns of use for specific predicates Finally our data are observations gleaned from parent report CDI instruments are both reliable and valid and the crosslinguistic adaptations we used contain the original researchers best attempts to create culturallyappropriate word lists Nevertheless this observational design introduces many sources of uncertainty and bias First the open data format of Wordbank reflects the sampling and administration methods of many groups around the world these introduce many unknown biases that we cannot control though they would likely not contribute to observed consistencies Second language and culture covary completely in our sample and so variability that we observe cannot be attributed to one or the other Finally some observed consistencies could arise from consistency in parental reporting biases For example across languages parents might be generally biased to underreport comprehension of function words Despite the quantity of data analyzed here our conclusions will require further testing through converging evidence from both laboratory experiments and direct observation In sum by examining predictors of early word learning across languages we identified substantial crosslinguistic consistency in the factors contributing to the ease or difficulty of learning individual words These findings testify to the importance of building open shared resources in the study of language learning without the efforts of many research groups across many language communities such studies would be impossible In addition we hope that our work here provides a baseline for the building of future predictive models that allow theories of language learning to be tested at scale Acknowledgements Thank you to the labs and individuals who contributed data to Wordbank and to NSF BCS for support References
