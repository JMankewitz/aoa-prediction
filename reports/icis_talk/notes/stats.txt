# colinearity
residualization shouldn't have change anything, mathematically
when predictors are highly correlated, it makes sense that uncertainty blows up -- there's not enough data to distinguish effects
-> get rid of residualization, if things look bad throw out highly correlated predictors

# developmental analysis
instead of two stage model of estimating AoA and then predicting it, have one model that directly predicts how many kids know word at each age from the predictors
then use interaction terms with age on each predictor to get developmental effects
