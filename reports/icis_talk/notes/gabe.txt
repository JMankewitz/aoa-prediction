* what's an example of a Markman constraint/bias? Not clear how this
is different from the social cues to me as an outsider
* "Approach" slide: proportion/age plot fits aren't logisitics, right?
(I know this is the least important point I could make)
* other "Approach" slide: separate out the preceding work from the
questions you're askign, even with just an extra line break
* subbullets get pretty small font size
* comprehension/production plot slide: the density plots are % of word
that first pass 50% in each month?
 * might want to point out that it's not cumulative to make sure no
one gets confused
* isn't laplace smoothing really bad for something like rare
occurrences of words? (Chen & Goodman 96, maybe?)
 * i'd think a variant of backoff makes more sense -- I know it
doesn't mattter much nor for this audience, though
* do you want to mention type & token counts when you're dividing into
nouns/preds/fn/other?
 * i think it's important for them to be thinking about how they
differ overall to better understand how their factor effects differ
* concreteness age difference - about "less importance" than "less predictive"?
 * why is concreteness effect negative?
 * what the plot is quantifying is a little hard to understand
* here's a terrible idea for showing all the langauges in a way that
would allow easy pattern recognition: a GIF
 * if you just flip through them, maybe with low-aplha background
values of the non-focus langauges, that conceptually seems cool but is
definitely not the right solution
